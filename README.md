# The hydra game

The Hydra is a rooted tree. The object of the game is to chop off all its heads (the blue disks). At step `n`, when you cut a head, the Hydra will grow `n` new copies of the tree growing from the neck at which the head was cut.

A theorem by Paris and Kirby [1] states that *you always win*, no matter how you chop the heads, but it takes a rather long time to chop down a hydra. Paris and Kirby also showed that Peano arithmetic does not prove that hydra always loses.

The Hydra game was implemented by [Andrej Bauer](http://andrej.com/) using a technology invented in the twentieth century known as "Java." The "applet" depended on [NPAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPAPI) which was powered by a steam engine.
